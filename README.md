# SMS-Spam-Detection

## About

Spam filtering using machine learning has become common among email providers. However, spam filtering of SMS text messages has not been widely implemented. A big reason for SMS to be lagging behind email in terms of spam filtering is the lack of a large, quality SMS text dataset. This dataset from UCI (see below) combines multiple different datasets together to provide an industry-leading SMS spam vs ham dataset. 

This project is intended to demonstrate proficiency with working with text data, NLP techniques, and creating highly tuned models. 

## Dataset

This project was inspired by the SMS Spam Collection dataset from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. The dataset claims to be the largest collection of real, unencoded SMS messages available. The dataset and a more in depth description can be accessed here:

## Running the project

To run the project, clone the repo into your workspace:
```
git clone https://github.com/bengruher/SMS-Spam-Detection
```

and open the sms-spam-detection.ipynb Jupyter notebook. Press Shift-Enter to run each cell. Note that your execution times may vary. The notebook was originally run on an ml.t2.medium EC2 instance from AWS.

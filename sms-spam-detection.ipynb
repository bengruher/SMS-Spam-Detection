    "Spam filtering using machine learning has become common among email providers. However, spam filtering of SMS text messages has not been widely implemented. A big reason for SMS to be lagging behind email in terms of spam filtering is the lack of a large, quality SMS text dataset. This dataset from UCI combines multiple different datasets together to provide an industry-leading SMS spam vs ham dataset.\n",

    "These messages are primarily from the UK, so the English is not typical for me and there are a lot of different spellings. That being said, there are still some obvious mispellings, such as \"womdarfull\", \"frndsship\", etc. There is also a lot of slang/shorthand, such as \"b'day\", \"gr8\", \"K\", \"Dis\", \"thx\", etc. There are also abbreviations such as \"LOL\". There are also some messages in other languages. I'm also noticing some weird characters, such as \"`&lt; #&gt;`\" indicating that the less-than and great-than symbols were used. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, after futher inspection of ham messages, I'm rethinking the idea to preserve capitalization. There are several ham messages that contain heavy capitalization as well, which means that capitalization is not necessarily and indication of spam and adding those words as special tokens may add unnecessary features or noise to the dataset. It may be interesting, however, to explore the correlation between the position of those capital letters within the message to the spam/ham label.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also punctuation that tends to be more indicative of a ham message, such as a smiley face :) or :-). I think preserving these types of symbols and punctuation marks might be valuable for the model. "

However, ham messages have far more outliers and can have over 35 capitalized words. Therefore, capitalization is not necessarily an indication of spam. Capitalization of certain words may still be indicative of spam, however, as we will explore below. We will use the word \"free\" and see how many times the word is capitalized in spam messages vs ham messages."
